# Problem Statement

Anybody looking for a specific type of beer or brewery in the Madison area may have a difficult time finding a singular 
source for this information. Local watering holes tend to have a Facebook page or a poorly maintained website that may or may
not contain the latest information regarding what kind of offerings they have on tap. 

# Project Objectives

- Consolidate all information regarding what's on tap in the Madison area, specifically Atwood and surrounding areas. 
- Allow people to update the current tap list for the bars and restaurants participating.
- Allow people to delete entries that are no longer accurate for each bar or restaurant. 
- Allow users to modify information about existing offerings. 
- Allow users to add new beers as they come on tap at a local bar or restaurant.
